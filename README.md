# RockFS

RockFS -- is a File System supported by a single cloud or cloud-of-clouds resilient to client side attacks.

RockFS provides two sets of security mechanisms to be integrated with the client-side of a file system:
 * a *recovery service* capable of undoing unintended file operations without losing valid file operations that occurred after the attack; and
 * *device data security mechanisms* to safely store encryption keys reducing the probability of having the credentials compromised by attackers and to protect cached data.

RockFS works with a single storage cloud or with several storage clouds (cloud-of-clouds). It is compatible with AWS-S3, BackBlaze B2, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft AzureBlob and RackSpace Cloud Files. RockFS requires a coordination service an it is compatible with DepSpace and Zookeeper (to de implemented soon). For testing purposes it is also possible to test RockFS without a coordination service, in that case the metadata of the File System is kept in memory during execution and discarded afterwards. The figure below shows the system architecture of RockFS.

To perform recovery RockFS saves logs of file operations. Each log entry is composed by two parts, the data part, that goes to the storage clouds, and the metadata part, which goes to the coordination service. The figure below shows how loggin is done.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

RockFS uses FUSE library. You need  to install the following tools before using RockFS.


| Supported platforms                                           |     |      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----|------|
| Linux (sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev)                      | x64 | x86  |
| MacOS (via [osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/))             | x64 | x86  |
| Windows (via [winfsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/))| x64 | n/a  |

Please make sure you have at least Java 7 installed and Maven.

### Installing

Before running RockFS execute the following command to install the required libs to you local Maven repository.

```
sh install.sh
```


## Running RockFS

Before executing RockFS edit the `safecloudfs.properties` file in `config` folder.

If you're planning to setup RockFS using DepSpace as the coordination service we recommend the following implementation of [DepSpace](https://github.com/inesc-id/depspacito).

Default execution arguments are set in the pom.xml file.

### Arguments

* --mount [path] - Directory to be mount
* --config [path] - Path for the RockFS configuration file (For example: config/safecloudfs.properties). More about the configuration file [here](doc/CONFIG_FILE.md).
* -- debug <ALL, SIMPLE, WARNING, SEVERE, INFO, FINE, FINER, FINEST> - Execute with debug log messages

### Running localy
```
mvn exec:java
```


### Running via Docker

If you intend to user DepSpace a the coordination service for RockFS, you need to start it first. Instructions on how to start DepSpace can be found [here](https://github.com/inesc-id/depspacito).

Before running RockFS first edit `config/accounts.json` with the access credentials to the cloud providers and `config/safecloudfs.properties` with the configuration of RockFS (for example, to indicate the path to the config folder of DepSpace or the address of the Zookeeper servers).

The Dockerfile in the root of the project allows to execute RockFS through a Debian VM. To build and run the VM execute the following commands:

```
docker build -t safecloudfs .
docker run -it --privileged --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse -i safecloudfs
```

Then inside the container execute

```
sh run.sh
```

Or execute the following command to mount a specific dir located in /path/to/dir:

```
sh run.sh /path/to/dir
```


### Running via Docker compose

First, edit the `accounts.json` and `safecloudfs.properties` files in the `docker-compose/SafeCloudFS` folder.

Then, inside the folder `docker-compose`, execute:

```
docker-compose up
```
